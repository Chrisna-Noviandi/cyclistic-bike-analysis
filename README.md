# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis 🚲

This case study explores user behavior from the Cyclistic bike-share system using R. The goal is to identify trends and differences between casual users and members, and provide strategic recommendations to improve user retention.

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and transform Divvy trip data from 2019 and 2020
- Analyze ride patterns by user type
- Visualize ride duration and weekly trends
- Suggest membership promotion strategies

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `janitor`, `skimr`
- R Markdown (`.Rmd`) for reproducible report
- ggplot2 for visualization

## 📈 Key Findings

- Casual users take longer rides, especially on weekends and Thursdays
- Members tend to have shorter, more consistent rides (likely for commuting)
- Opportunity exists to convert casual users into members through ride-duration-based promotions

## 📁 Files

- `analysis.R` – Main analysis script
- `analysis.Rmd` – R Markdown for generating report
